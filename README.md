# React + Vite

My Project Name is React Router.

App Component (App.jsx):
This component serves as the main entry point for this application.
It sets up the routing configuration and renders the navigation menu along with the corresponding components for each route.

Navigation Component (Middlebar.jsx):
This component handles the rendering of the navigation menu.
It contains the list of navigation links (NavLink) to different course categories.

Course Category Components:
These components represent the content for each course category.
Each component contains the static content related to the respective course category.

Routing Setup:
In App.js, import BrowserRouter from react-router-dom and wrap your entire application with it.
Use Route components to define the mapping between paths and components.
Ensure that the navigation links (NavLink) in Navigation.js match the paths specified in your Route components.

Static Content:
Define static content for each course category within their respective components.
This content could include descriptions, course titles, images, etc.

Running the Application:
Once your project is set up, run it using npm start or yarn start depending on your package manager.
Navigate to different routes using the links provided in the navigation menu.
